# Menu-Driven Python Utility Project

## Description
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the use of functions, loops, and conditional statements through multiple utilities in a single program. It is designed as a menu-driven application, allowing users to select and perform different tasks.

## Features
- **Simple Calculator**: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
- **Even, Odd & Prime Checker**: Checks whether a number is even or odd and if it is a prime number.
- **Factorial & Fibonacci Generator**: Calculates the factorial of a number and generates the Fibonacci series.
- **String Operations**: Reverses a string and checks if it is a palindrome.
- **Multiplication Table Generator**: Generates multiplication tables for any number.

## Concepts Used
- Python functions and modular programming
- Loops (`for`, `while`) and conditional statements
- String handling
- Error handling (basic)
